A comprehensive script runner with a bunch of scripts to install Debian or arch Desktop Manager with my preffered apps and configs on a fresh install debian or arch empty base.
I just wanted to make my life easier and implement all the apps, settings and configs/extensions that i prefer.
the script runner uses tmux for multiplexing the installs by splitting the tty into 2 vertical panes - one for the install information and the other is for the install progress, giving me more readable area for details and headlines
